# water-drink-water
An application to help you remember to drink water.

This accompanies streams on https://twitch.tv/tbdgamer so, there are a few guidelines to follow with PRs. 

Guidelines

- No major stand-alone PRs, i.e. Don't do a PR with "I made it DDD or here's the project implemented with the 'right' architecture"
- You're more than welcome to pick up existing issues, and make a fix for them.
- If you feel you found a bug or an issue, create an issue on the GH board, make a PR for the issue. 
- Welcome to make alternative UI, add under clients folder name <technology.initials>
   - Must not change API to accomodate (other than CORS)
- All PRs will be reviewed on stream
- There's no "right" or "wrong", "bad" or "good" but making a PR doesn't mean it will get merged.
- These guidelines aren't final
